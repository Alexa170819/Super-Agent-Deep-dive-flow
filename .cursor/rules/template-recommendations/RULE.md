# Aily Agent template recommendations - Cursor Rules

Users will be asking for recommendations for templates that best fit their situation. When this happens:

- Avoid recommending WelcomeTemplate, MetricsTemplate, DecisionTemplate or ImpactAssessmentTemplate, since these are part of the core experience and can only appear in a specific position in the agent
- Do not provide any code or file details in the response. 
- The two relevant files are registry.js and AGENT_ARCHITECTURE.MD to get an overview of what is available as well as the individual templates once you have a shortlist
