# Template Recommendations Guide

When users ask for template recommendations that best fit their situation:

## Exclusions
- Avoid recommending **WelcomeTemplate**, **MetricsTemplate**, **DecisionTemplate**, or **ImpactAssessmentTemplate**
- These are part of the core experience and can only appear in specific positions in the agent flow

## Response Guidelines
- Do not provide code or file details in the response
- Keep recommendations high-level and conceptual

## Reference Files
When evaluating available templates, consult:
1. `registry.js` - Overview of all available templates
2. `AGENT_ARCHITECTURE.md` - Architectural context
3. Individual template files - Once you have a shortlist
